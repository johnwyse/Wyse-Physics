## Physics

This single page web app has a homepage and 3 topic pages: 
- force
- kinetic energy
- acceleration

Each page shows a reference guide of definitions, formulas, symbols, units etc. as well as an example image.

Using JavaScript, each page also provides a sample calculator for the given formula and generates random practice problems. Users are given feedback on their answers. 

This project was made from scratch.
